✨ Assamese Image Caption Writing

🎯 Assamese Image Caption Writing is an AI-powered system that generates Assamese-language captions for images. This project is designed to recognize cultural elements and provide meaningful descriptions, bridging the gap between technology and Assamese heritage.

🌟 Features

✅ Assamese Image Captioning – Generate captions in Assamese for uploaded images.
✅ Cultural Object Recognition – Identify traditional dances, objects, and rural scenes.

📂 Dataset

A carefully curated dataset featuring Assamese cultural and rural life, including:
🎭 Traditional dance forms
🏡 Rural landscapes
🛕 Historical and cultural objects

🛠 Technologies Used

🔹 Deep Learning – (CNN + LSTM / Transformer-based models)
🔹 PyTorch – For training and inference
🔹 Web Framework – Flask / Django for the user interface
🔹 Frontend – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ Upload an image through the web interface.
2️⃣ The model processes the image and generates a caption in Assamese.
